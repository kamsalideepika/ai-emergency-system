# 🚑 AI Emergency Pressure & Ambulance Load Prediction System

## 📌 Project Overview

The **AI Emergency Pressure & Ambulance Load Prediction System** is an AI-driven emergency preparedness framework designed to help hospitals and emergency authorities predict sudden Emergency Department (ED) overloads.

The system analyzes:

- Accident history  
- Ambulance arrival patterns  
- Seasonal/Festival spikes  
- Zone-based hotspot risk  
- Emergency pressure forecasting  

This helps reduce chaos, improve response readiness, and optimize hospital and ambulance resource allocation.

# ✅ Phase 1: Core Implementation & Foundation (MVP)

Phase 1 focused on building the minimum viable product (MVP) foundation.



## 🎯 Objective

The system aims to:

- Predict emergency pressure on hospitals  
- Identify accident-prone hotspot zones  
- Forecast ambulance arrival density  
- Trigger early alerts for emergency preparedness  



## ✅ Phase 1 Features Implemented

### Core Entities (Data Models)

- **Hospital**
- **Accident**
- **Ambulance Arrival Logs**

### MVP Core Functionalities

- Emergency Pressure Prediction API  
- Accident Hotspot Zone Identification API  
- FastAPI backend foundation  
- Clean modular folder structure  

---

# ✅ Phase 2: Logic Expansion & Enhancements

Phase 2 extended the MVP with real-world business logic and scalability improvements.



## 🎯 Objective

Enhance the system to support:

- Modular architecture separation  
- Geospatial + time-series modeling readiness  
- City-level scalability  
- Dashboard-first visualization support  
- Real-time alert threshold logic  
- API-consumable prediction models  



## ✅ Phase 2 Enhancements Implemented

- Modular structure for backend + ML logic separation  
- Improved validations and edge-case handling  
- Accident hotspot detection service improvements  
- Alert-based emergency pressure prediction logic  
- Optimized service-layer design for future ML integration  

---

## 🧠 Logic: Emergency Load Forecasting (Future Scope)

Phase 2 forecasting logic includes:

1. Building time-series models for ER pressure prediction  
2. Modeling seasonal, festival, and weather effects  
3. Predicting daily/hourly overload windows  
4. Validating and tuning forecasting accuracy

# ✅ Phase 3: Final Polish, Security & Completion

Phase 3 focused on making the project production-ready.



## 🎯 Objective

Finalize the application with:

- Security improvements  
- Better error handling  
- Deployment readiness  
- Collaboration preparation  



## ✅ Phase 3 Completion Updates

- Added stronger validation and alert threshold support  
- Improved API error response structure  
- Introduced environment-based configuration using `.env`  
- Prepared repository for final submission and HealBharat collaboration
